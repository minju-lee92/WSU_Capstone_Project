# WSU_Capstone_Project

## Description
The Capstone course aims at providing students with an opportunity to integrate and apply the
algorithms, methods and tools they have learned throughout the program to solve real-world data
analysis problems that have an interdisciplinary nature. Students will conduct a team-based project
that involves the main aspects of the data analytics process, and will submit a consolidated report
and give a presentation at the conclusion of the project. The course serves as a final preparation for
students entering into the profession. Students get experience in working as teams, participating in
project planning and scheduling, writing reports, giving presentations, and interpreting results in a
professional manner.
